1.Like any real situaton,
We go Ramp up the users from slowy until we reach the desired VU'S/Throughput
then we stay there for 80% of the time

then we slowly ramp down the users 

Ramp -Up: Slowly and by 10% of the duration we will reach desired state

Ramp -Down: Slowly and by 10% of the duration we will decrease desired state to minimum
