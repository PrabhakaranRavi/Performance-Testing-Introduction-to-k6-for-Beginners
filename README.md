# Performance Testing with k6

Welcome to my **Performance Testing with k6** study notes! This repository is where I, as a beginner learner, am recording what Iâ€™m learning about performance testing for web applications and APIs using k6. The focus is on understanding the basics of performance testing, writing tests, and analyzing results.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of my notes and scripts as I explore performance testing with k6. It's intended to help me (and hopefully others) get familiar with performance testing concepts, how to write tests with k6, and how to analyze the results.

## Features

- **Performance Testing Basics**: Learn the core concepts of performance testing.
- **Writing Scripts with k6**: Create performance tests using the k6 scripting language.
- **Types of Tests**: Explore load tests, stress tests, and spike tests.
- **Understanding Performance Metrics**: Gain insights into key performance metrics.
- **Checks and Assertions**: Validate application behavior under load.
- **Defining Thresholds**: Set performance expectations and validate them during tests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [k6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript.
- Access to a web application or API for testing. You can use [test.k6.io](https://test.k6.io/) to practice.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/performance-testing-with-k6.git
   cd performance-testing-with-k6
